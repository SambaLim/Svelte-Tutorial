# 1. Introduction

## What is Svelte?

- Compiler for creating **reactive** web apps & interfaces
- Can be used for small parts of a site, or entirely(SPA)

## Other Framework Differences

- Svelte is a **compiler** not a framework
- Svelte compiles your code for production at build time into a single, vanilla, Javascript bundle

- No extra scripts or libraries are shipped to production
- Often results in a faster running website
